### Agile

I strongly believe "agile" is an adjective, not a noun. Therefore, agility
should be built in on everything we do. When [building a successful startup
from scratch](/cv#project-indoor-positioning) in a economically unstable
country such as Brazil, agility was vital to the survival of the company. I
think that helped me build a natural agile mindset.

The methodology with which I have most experience is Kanban.

### Algorithms

I'm a bit of a Logic nerd, therefore I'm also a bit of a algorithm nerd. I feel
comfortable analyzing, designing and tweaking many kinds of algorithms, but I
especially like heuristic searches. In fact, tweaking algorithms is pretty much
all I do in my pet project [OperaPlan](/cv#operaplan).

### Ansible

I've used Ansible for about two years, to manage both on-premises and virtual
cloud servers. In 2017 my company has moved on to cloud-managed Kubernetes, and
since then my Ansible skills got a little rusty, but I'm confident I could pick
it up again fast, should the need arise.

### Artificial Intelligence

Being the algorithm nerd I am, many areas of AI interest me:

- I have build, deployed and maintained machine learning models when working on
  the [Indoor Positioning project](/cv#project-indoor-positioning).
- I also have build, deployed and maintained heuristic search algorithms on the
  [Process Optimization project](/cv#project-process-optimization)
- I have a solid grasp of Game Theory. I've been wanting to get into
  [Agent-based Computational
  Economics](http://www2.econ.iastate.edu/tesfatsi/ace.htm), but still haven't
  really gotten around to that yet.

### DevOps

I think DevOps as the name of a position or a team [is a bit
weird](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DevOpsCulture.html), but I get what you
mean. In that sense, I think I was lucky, because up until now I have
always worked in places with a strong DevOps culture. I have always been
responsible for taking care of my code during all its lifecycle, including
running and monitoring it, and I learned a lot because of this.

The [first years at Novid√°](/cv#project-indoor-positioning) were quite
Ops-heavy because, in order to save money with server bills, we would change
cloud providers every year, seeking those "free trials" for startups that almost
all of the cloud providers offer.

We started at AWS, then IBM's Softlayer, then Azure and finally Google Cloud
Platform. All those changes were naturally very stressful and required a lot of
work, but they have led us to operate in a very cloud-agnostic way, based on
Kubernetes.

So, that left me with some knowledge of all those cloud providers, although I
didn't have much chance to explore their tools in depth, since we were mostly
rolling our own.

### Django

I first had contact with Django in 2016 and it was love at first sight. I have
chosen to use Django + Django Rest Framework for every application I've written
in Python since 2017. I know pretty well the ins and outs of the framework and
I think it's a superb tool for many kinds of projects.

I have written applications with it in the "default" architecture as well as in
conjunction with an "Hexagonal" architecture, in order to make the domain model
stand out better, unhindered by infrastructure code.

### Docker

I have been using Docker in production since 2017. I think it's a superb tool,
even though sometimes it does have a few counter-intuitive and hard to debug
problems.

I'm also comfortable with image optimization and multi-stage builds.

### Domain-Driven Design

Essential technique in my toolset. I have been using DDD and pushing it in my
company in one way or another since 2017. Even though the beginning was a
little awkward (the learning curve can be pretty steep), I now consider myself
able to properly apply both the tactical and strategic patterns in a way that
makes sense to the project I'm working on.

Even though some of the techniques aren't really well suited for all software
projects, I believe that a "domain first" approach is always beneficial.

### Fast paced environments

I can't think of a faster environment than [a tiny startup rising up from the
ground](/cv#project-indoor-positioning). Honestly, I love this kind of
environment (in fact, our office was on a old house where two of the team
members lived). I work my best when I can go to sleep with a problem in my
head, wake up with the solution, share it with everyone and go make it.

On the other hand, such environments are prone to the "permanent sense of
impending doom syndrome", and it's not a easy task for management to avoid
that. As such, I think that a open feedback culture is a hard requisite for
having a healthy fast paced work environment. Sometimes we just need to take a
step back and take a good look at our priorities, everyone works better when
they're feeling safe.

### Git

I have been using git professionally almost every day since 2017. At this
point, it's almost second nature for me, although I still have to take a look
at the docs to do some of the "set and forget" things such as submodules and
hooks. I have worked with trunk based development and with feature branches.

### Java

I first learned Java when I was 13 years old, because I wanted to make
cross-platform GUI programs for my friends. Since then, I have been using it on
some of my projects (mostly whatever needs high throughput), but more intensely
since 2018.

Java doesn't get much love out there, but it's one of my favorite languages.
It's compatible with absolutely everything, the JVM is a wonder of modern
engineering, and the language lends itself very well for work with larger,
heterogeneous teams.

I think most of the hate on Java is caused by people misusing or abusing OOP.

### Linux

I have been using Linux on my personal computer since 2008, and then on almost
every server, container and VM I have ever managed. I would say I have a pretty
good grasp on Linux operation and administration. Through the years, I have
used Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora and Alpine.

### MongoDB

I have been using MongoDB on some of my projects since 2016, sometimes as an
auxiliary database, sometimes as the main database. Although it's usually not
my first choice (too easy to run on nasty N+1 problems), I think MongoDB can
work very well when paired with Domain-Driven Design, as properties of a
Document fit quite nicely those of an Aggregate.
