### Agile

I strongly believe "agile" is an adjective, not a noun. Therefore, agility
should be built in on everything we do. When [building a successful startup
from scratch](/cv#project-indoor-positioning) in a economically unstable
country such as Brazil, agility was vital to the survival of the company. I
think that helped me build a natural agile mindset.

The methodology with which I have most experience is Kanban.

### Algorithms

I'm a bit of a Logic nerd, therefore I'm also a bit of a algorithm nerd. I feel
comfortable analyzing, designing and tweaking many kinds of algorithms, but I
especially like heuristic searches. In fact, tweaking algorithms is pretty much
all I do in my pet project [OperaPlan](/cv#operaplan).

### Ansible

I've used Ansible for about two years, to manage both on-premises and virtual
cloud servers. In 2017 my company has moved on to cloud-managed Kubernetes, and
since then my Ansible skills got a little rusty, but I'm confident I could pick
it up again fast, should the need arise.

### Artificial Intelligence

Being the algorithm nerd I am, many areas of AI interest me:

- I have build, deployed and maintained machine learning models when working on
  the [Indoor Positioning project](/cv#project-indoor-positioning).
- I also have build, deployed and maintained heuristic search algorithms on the
  [Process Optimization project](/cv#project-process-optimization)
- I have a solid grasp of Game Theory. I've been wanting to get into
  [Agent-based Computational
  Economics](http://www2.econ.iastate.edu/tesfatsi/ace.htm), but still haven't
  really gotten around to that yet.

### Docker

I have been using Docker in production since 2017. I think it's a superb tool, even
though sometimes it does have a few counter-intuitive and hard to debug problems.

I'm also comfortable with image optimization and multi-stage builds.

### Domain-Driven Design

Essential technique in my toolset. I have been using DDD and pushing it in my
company in one way or another since late 2017. Even though the beginning was a
little awkward (the learning curve can be pretty steep), I now consider myself
able to apply both the tactical and strategic patterns in any project I work on.

Even though some of the techniques aren't really well suited for all software
projects, I believe that a "domain first" mindset is always beneficial.
